### Understanding the Italian Structure:

1. **Sebben, crudele**:  
   "Sebben" (although) is used as a concessive conjunction, meaning it introduces a condition or something contrary to expectation. The adjective **"crudele"** (cruel) directly modifies the implied subject, which is **you** (the one being addressed).

2. **Mi fai languir**:  
   In Italian, personal pronouns like **"mi"** (me) are placed before the verb. **"Fai"** (you make) is the second-person singular form of "fare" (to make/do). **"Languir"** is the infinitive form of "languire" (to languish), and Italian often drops the final "e" in poetic or musical settings for rhythm.

3. **Sempre fedele**:  
   This is a straightforward phrase meaning "always faithful." In Italian, adjectives like **"fedele"** (faithful) follow the noun they describe or, as in this case, can follow "sempre" (always) in a more flexible poetic structure.

4. **Ti voglio amar**:  
   "Ti" (you) is the indirect object placed before the verb, and **"voglio"** (I want) is the first-person singular form of "volere" (to want). **"Amar"** is the poetic form of "amare" (to love), with the final "e" dropped for musicality.

5. **Con la lunghezza del mio servir**:  
   "Con" (with) introduces the prepositional phrase. **"Lunghezza"** (length) is the subject, with **"del mio servir"** (of my service) being a possessive phrase where **"servir"** is again the poetic form of "servire" (to serve).

6. **La tua fierezza**:  
   **"Fierezza"** (pride) is the subject, with **"la tua"** (your) as the possessive adjective, matching the noun in gender and number.

7. **Saprò stancar**:  
   **"Saprò"** is the future tense of "sapere" (to know), indicating **"I will know how"** or **"I will be able to."** **"Stancar"** (to tire) is again a poetic shortening of "stancare."

### Italian Sentence Logic:

- **Sebben, crudele**: In Italian, sentences often begin with a conjunction (like "Sebben") followed by adjectives. The subject is implied (in this case, "you").

- **Mi fai languir**: Italian sentences place pronouns like "mi" (me) before the verb. Infinitive verbs like **"languir"** are commonly used after auxiliary verbs like "fai" (you make).

- **Sempre fedele, ti voglio amar**: Italian allows flexibility in sentence structure. Here, **"fedele"** can appear after "sempre," and **"amar"** follows "ti voglio" smoothly due to the poetic need to omit the final "e."

- **Con la lunghezza del mio servir**: Prepositions like "con" (with) introduce the logical cause ("with the length of my service"), and possessive phrases are structured similarly to English, with "del" being the contraction of **"di il"** (of the).

- **La tua fierezza saprò stancar**: The sentence places the subject **"la tua fierezza"** (your pride) first, followed by the future verb "saprò" (I will know how) and then the infinitive **"stancar"** (to tire).

By breaking down this way, you can see how Italian sentences often use contractions for smoother flow and position pronouns and adjectives differently than in English. The flexibility in Italian structure, especially in poetic forms, allows for more varied word orders while still retaining clarity.
