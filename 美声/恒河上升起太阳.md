### Understanding the Italian Structure:

1. **Già il sole dal Gange**:  
   Italian often places the subject ("il sole" – the sun) after introductory words like "già" (already). "Dal Gange" shows the source ("from the Ganges"), where "dal" is the contraction of "da" (from) and "il" (the).

2. **Più chiaro sfavilla**:  
   Adjectives like "chiaro" (bright) can be modified by "più" (more) to express a comparison (brighter). "Sfavilla" (sparkles) is the verb, placed at the end of the sentence.

3. **E terge ogni stilla dell'alba che piange**:  
   Here, the verb "terge" (wipes away) is followed by the object "ogni stilla" (every drop). Italian uses relative clauses like "che piange" (that cries) to describe "alba" (dawn).

4. **Col raggio dorato**:  
   The preposition "col" (with the) is a contraction of "con il." Italian uses these often for smoother flow.

5. **Ingemma ogni stelo**:  
   The verb "ingemma" (adorns) is placed first, followed by the object "ogni stelo" (every stem). Italian typically places verbs before objects.

6. **E gli astri del cielo dipinge nel prato**:  
   Italian sentences often use "gli astri del cielo" (the stars of the sky) in a descriptive way, followed by the action verb "dipinge" (paints). The sentence ends with the location "nel prato" (in the meadow).

By breaking down the structure, you'll notice that Italian often starts with actions (verbs) and places descriptive elements (like prepositional phrases) after the main components, which might be different from the typical English sentence structure.
